    Fixes an issue in which riot generated a requirements lockfile for a Venv instance other than the one it was running tests for.
    This behavior was happening due to logic that skipped Venv instances with pkgs == None while preparing the environment,
    but not while running tests. The fix is to stop riot from ignoring pkgs-less Venvs in all cases.
