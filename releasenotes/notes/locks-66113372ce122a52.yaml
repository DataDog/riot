features:
  - Adds the ``riot requirements <hash>`` command, which uses pip-compile to generate a requirements lockfile for venv identified by the hash
  - |
    Adds the ``-c/--recompile-requirements`` flag to ``riot run``. When set, this flag causes the requirements.txt lockfile and the venv itself
    to be regenerated. When omitted, the requirements lockfile is only built if it does not already exist.
